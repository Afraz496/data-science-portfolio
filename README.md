# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio encompasses 5 types of Data Science projects:

1. Tabular Datasets (Housing Prices, Stock Prices etc)
2. Tabular Datasets with Class Imbalance
3. Computer Vision
4. Natural Language Processing (with a focus on sentiment extraction)
5. Neural Networks and High Performance Computing

This README serves as a guide through the projects, their relevant datasets and some decisions surrounding the Machine Learning exercises in each projects. The README will also cover how to use this repository if you wish to implement these projects on your own but please be sure to cite the creators of the repository: Afraz Arif Khan and Aamir Zargham.

## Dependencies

## Project 1: Tabular Datasets

Tabular Datasets form the backbone of all Machine Learning problems. The terminology for this section 'tabular' is deliberately ambiguous. We will examine Regression and Classification problems but will keep other parameters consistent (like class imblanace) to make less complex machine learning problems. The goal is to examine ideal datasets under relatively ideal conditions and build the backbone of Machine Learning Pipelines.
